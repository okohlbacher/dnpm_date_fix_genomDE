# DNPM submission data fix-up tool UKE## OverviewA Python CLI tool for parsing submission ## Requirements- Python 3.9+- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)- executes from the command line - command line parameters specify an input and output directory as well   as a config file that are in the local filesystem- Input files reside in the specified input directory- Output files are created only in the spcecified output directory- Input and output files are only valid JSON files- There are two different types of JSON files that adhere to the examples    in Test Data (two different types of files: files with a name starting with   MVH_MTBPatientRecord_Patient (patient record files)   and files starting with SubmissionReport_Patient (submission report files))- Examples of the two JSON files are in the directory "Test Data"## Command Structure0. when called without parameters or with the --help parameter, the tool    displays its usage1. the tool's name is dnpm_fixup.py2. Parse the command line parameters. Required parameters are '--config    <config_filename>', '--in-dir <input_directory>' , '--out-dir    <output_directory>' 3. parse the config file that is specified on the commandline by the    parameter -config <config_filename>   ## Functionality4. Check whether the input and output directories exist. Abort if they cannot be found or if the config file cannot be found5. The config file is a csv files that contains comma-separated information for a TAN, and a date (ISO8859 date time)6. Parse the config file and print the number of pairs of values - this is the number of files where the submission dates need to be corrected7. Check all files in the input directory and generate a list of all patient record files   and submission report files8. Read all of these files, and for each do the following   - parse the JSON contained in the file    - if it is a patient record file: extract the field "transferTAN" as 'TAN'   - if it is a submission report file: extract the field "id" as TAN   - Check if the TAN read from the file can be found in the list of TANs to      fixed from the config file    - if there is a match, create a copy of the file in the output directory     with the same name it had in the input directory     - modify the parsed JSON from the input file and replace     the value of the field "submittedAt" (if it is a patient record file)      or the value of the field "createdAt" (if it is a submission report)      with the data read from the config file for the corresponding TAN   - write the modified JSON to the output file and print the tan and date      of the fixed file to the console       ## Error Handling- report how many files have been modified- report any errors to the console- if any of the directories cannot or the config file cannot be found  print an error to the console and abort execution- if a file cannot be read or created or is not in JSON format, print an error, but continue with the next file## License MIT
